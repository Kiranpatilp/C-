All about C++ STL components
============================

Containers =

Containers can be described as the object that hold the data of the same type. Containers are used
to implement different data structures for example arrays, list, trees, etc.

1]Vector =

vector is a class that creates a dynamic array allowing insertions and deletions at the back.
Header file = <vector>
iterator = Random access
=============================================================================
2]List =

list is the sequence containers that allow the insertions and deletions from anywhere.
Header file = <list>
iterator = Bidirectional
=============================================================================
3]deque=

deque is the double ended queue that allows the insertion and deletion from both the ends.
Header file = <deque>
iterator = Random access
=============================================================================
4]set =

set is an associate container for storing unique sets.
Header file = <set>
iterator = Bidirectional
=============================================================================
5]multiset =

Multiset is an associate container for storing non- unique sets.
Header file = <set>
iterator = Bidirectional
=============================================================================
6]map =

Map is an associate container for storing unique key-value pairs, i.e. each key is associated with only
one value(one to one mapping).
Header file = <map>
iterator = Bidirectional
========================================================================
7]multimap =

multimap is an associate container for storing key- value pair, and each key can be associated with
more than one value.
Header file = <map>
iterator = Bidirectional
=============================================================================
8]stack =

It follows last in first out(LIFO).
Header file = <stack>
iterator = No iterator
=============================================================================
9]queue =

It follows first in first out(FIFO).
Header file = <queue>
iterator = No iterator
=========================
